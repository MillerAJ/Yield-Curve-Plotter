# Yield-Curve-Plotter
Plots Yield Curves

Fetches yield curve data from treasury.gov and plots yield curves. Currently looks back a given number of years and plots a given number of curves evenly spaced over the number of years given.

Currently working on moving legend outside of the graph. Then will add a way to look up individual/specific dates.
